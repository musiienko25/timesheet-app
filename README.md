# Task description

My task was to create a table from a list of employees and display their logged timesheets either in a modal or on a separate page. Each employee's timesheets had to be filterable by month.

I used the technologies that our web app used, such as Typescript, Bootstrap/React Bootstrap, and functional components. Additionally, I incorporated React's Context in some way in the application.

I obtained the list of employees from the users.json file and the timesheets from timesheets.json.
